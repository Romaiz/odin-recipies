    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sometimes all someone needs is some <em>sizzling, hot and crispy</em> chicken</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Buttermilk</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag. Seal the bag and shake until well-combined. </li>
        <li>Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both sides) until it's completely soaked in buttermilk.</li>
        <li> Place the soaked chicken in the bag with flour mixture, seal, and shake well to coat.</li>
        <li>Transfer the coated chicken to a baking sheet, and cover.</li>
        <li>Allow the flour coating to become a paste-like consistency. </li>
        <li>Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat.</li>
        <li>Brown the chicken on both sides, then reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and cook for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the cover, return the heat to high, and fry until extra crispy. Drain the chicken on paper towels. </li>
    </ol>
