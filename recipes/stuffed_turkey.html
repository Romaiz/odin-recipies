    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package herb-seasoned bread stuffing mix</li>
        <li>2 skinless boneless turkey breasts
        </li>
        <li>1 cup chopped pecans</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages dried, sweetened cranberries</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>6 lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Â½ cup pecan halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare stuffing mix according to package directions. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>With a sharp knife, butterfly breasts open to lay flat. Place each breast between two sheets of waxed paper, and flatten with a mallet.</li>
        <li>Spread the prepared stuffing to within 1/4 inch of the edge of each breast. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle each one with chopped pecans and dried cranberries, reserving some of the cranberries for garnish.</li>
        <li>. Roll up tightly in a jellyroll style, starting with the long end. </li>
        <li>Tuck in ends, and tie in sections with string, about 4 sections around the middle and one running the length of the roll to secure the ends.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Carefully brown rolls on all sides.</li>
        <li>Place skillet in oven, uncovered.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 1 hour, or until the internal temperature is at 170 degrees F (78 degrees C) when taken with a meat thermometer. Do not let these get overly dry.</li>
        <li>Allow rolls to set for 15 minutes before removing string, and slicing into 1/2 to 3/4 inch circles. </li>
        <li>Leave one roll whole, and slice the other for presentation. Stuffing will be spiraled into meat. </li>
        <li>Present on your prettiest platter on a bed of curly lettuce, and garnish by sprinkling with the remaining 1/2 cup pecan halves and the reserved dried cranberries.</li>
    </ol>
